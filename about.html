            I am a twenty-four year old certified yelper studying Healthcare Informatics. 
            As the first born girl to my parents, I was passed down tips and tricks to making cooking fun and worth-while. 
            Don't get me wrong, I enjoy takeout just as much as the other person but I find homecooked meals to taste better sometimes.
            I created this app to store all of my recipe data and share it with you all. 
            My favorite meal of the day is lunch/dinner as you can see from how much recipes i've gathered.
            I hope you enjoy the app as much as i've enjoyed creating it!!! :)
